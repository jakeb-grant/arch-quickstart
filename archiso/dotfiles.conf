# Dotfiles configuration for offline ISO builds
#
# This file specifies the dotfiles repository to include in the offline ISO.
# The dotfiles will be cloned to /opt/dotfiles on the ISO and applied
# automatically during installation using chezmoi.
#
# You can also override this by providing a dotfiles_repo input when
# manually triggering the workflow via GitHub Actions.
#
# Leave empty or comment out to skip including dotfiles in the offline ISO.
# In that case, the installer will prompt for a dotfiles URL (online mode)
# or skip dotfiles setup entirely (offline mode without network).

# Example:
# DOTFILES_REPO=https://github.com/username/dotfiles

DOTFILES_REPO=
